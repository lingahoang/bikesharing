# Citi Bike Sharing Business Proposal 

## Overview of the Project 

#### Executive Summary 

Last summer, my friend and I went to New York to explore hsitorical landmarks and hitting all different areas in the city. This summer, we went back to our hometown Des Moine, Iowa and realized biking was a crucial key during last yer vacation and decided to migrate it into the neighborhood. So we performed this analysis based of New York bike usage for August 2019 to see whether the business will be prosper in Des Moine. Using August as a data source for summer usage, we painted the picture and used Tableau for visualization to present data in charts, graphs, and other ideas to bring the bike action into the city. 

#### Data Sources

In this analysis, we used the data from New York Citi Bike program, and the data archive are available on the Citi Bike system database.

## Summary 

Based on the visual story on Tableau, there are a few key point from bikesharing activities from New York City:

  - Bike-sharing stations are high demand in walkting distance area. 
  - Male are the majority user during rush hours. 
  - Subscribers is the majority users for this service
  - The trip duration took less than 20 minutes
  
Based on this analysis, starting a bike-sharing program in Des Moines may be a good proposal especially if the business are taking place near high business located with walking distance area. However, there are a few things that we need to keep in mind that NYC and Des Moines are not exactly the same demo and geographic areas. It is recommended further analysis will be perform for better success in this business venture.
